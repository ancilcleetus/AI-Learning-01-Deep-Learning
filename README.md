# Deep Learning Foundations

This repo is an effort to document different Deep Learning Courses that I'm going through.

## Contents

### [Course 01: Dive into Deep Learning](/d2l-ancil)

"Dive into Deep Learning" (https://d2l.ai/) is an interactive Deep Learning book with code examples in MXNet, PyTorch and TensorFlow.

The book's github page (https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en) comes with notebooks for all example code in the book.

This project is an effort to personalize this material by creating new notebooks from scratch for PyTorch and TensorFlow that are relevant for my learning journey.

#### Chapter 01. Introduction
#### Chapter 02. Preliminaries [PyTorch](/d2l-ancil/pytorch/ch02-preliminaries/ch02-preliminaries.ipynb) [TensorFlow](/d2l-ancil/tensorflow/ch02-preliminaries/ch02-preliminaries.ipynb)

### [Course 02: Deep Learning by Yann LeCun](/deep-learning-nyu-yann-lecun-2020)

"Deep Learning by Yann LeCun" (https://cds.nyu.edu/deep-learning/) is offered at CDS (Center for Data Science), NYU (New York University).
