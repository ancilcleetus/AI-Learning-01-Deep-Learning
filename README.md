# Dive into Deep Learning

"Dive into Deep Learning" (https://d2l.ai/) is an interactive Deep Learning book with code examples in MXNet, PyTorch and TensorFlow.

The book's github page (https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en) comes with notebooks for all example code in the book.

This project is an effort to personalize this material by creating new notebooks from scratch for PyTorch and TensorFlow that are relevant for my learning journey.
