# Dive into Deep Learning

"Dive into Deep Learning" (https://d2l.ai/) is an interactive Deep Learning book with code examples in MXNet, PyTorch and TensorFlow.

The book's github page comes with notebooks for all example code in the book (which can be found inside d2l-en folder in this repo).

This project is an effort to personalize this material by creating new notebooks that are relevant for my learning journey.
